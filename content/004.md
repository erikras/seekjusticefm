  > 1. Women and men serve on felony trial juries at about the same rate.
  > 2. Prosecutors remove twice as many potential black jurors at trial as white jurors (20 percent of available black jurors compared with 10 percent of available white jurors).
  > 3. Judges remove 14 percent of available black jurors compared with 10 percent of available white jurors.
  > 4. Defense attorneys remove white jurors more often: they exclude 22 percent of the available white jurors versus 10 percent of the available black jurors.
  > 5. The differences in removal rates are different for urban and rural districts, with racial disparities larger on average in urban districts.
  > 6. The differences in removal rates are different from some urban districts than for other urban districts: the largest disparities occur in Charlotte, Durham, and Winston-Salem, while smaller disparities happen in Fayetteville, Greensboro, and Raleigh.
  > 7. Juries with more black males tend to acquit the defendant more often, all other things being equal.
  > 8. Juries with more white males tend to convict the defendant more often, all other things being equal.
  > 9. Juries with more black females tend to acquit more often, but only slightly; juries with more white females do not tend to acquit or convict any more often than the overall pool of trials.
