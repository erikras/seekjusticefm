> Working on criminal justice topics gives me a very different perspective on the Kochs than my equally-liberal friends & family have. [Charles Koch Foundation](https://www.charleskochfoundation.org) & [Charles Kock Institute](http://charleskochinstitute.org) are perhaps the most important funders of research related to criminal justice policy & reform.
>
> They also frequently host conferences that bring top-notch researchers and practitioners together in one room — a chance to meet everyone else who’s working in this space. In other words, they throw great parties — sounds trivial but this is super important & helpful!
>
> [Charles Koch Foundation](https://www.charleskochfoundation.org) has funded my own work related to prisoner reentry and I am deeply grateful for that as well as their broader support of my research. My contacts there & [Charles Kock Institute](http://charleskochinstitute.org) are the first I call if I’m looking for practioner contacts. They know everyone!
>
> As funders they are extremely hands-off — to a degree that is almost funny. I think they know people are watching them closely for missteps so are super careful. But most funders in this space have strong opinions abt what you should study & what you should find. They don’t.
>
> Koch Industries for a long time was a major proponent of Ban the Box policies. When my research on BTB (which they did not fund) came out, showing detrimental effects, they were eager to hear about it & engage w the results. I really appreciated that.
>
> To my fellow liberals that love to hate the Koch brothers, I simply say: the story is more complicated (as always, right?). Charles Koch in particular is enabling & supporting evidence-based CJ reform in red & blue states alike, and that is something we should all appreciate.

> The study, published in the journal _Science Advances_, uncovered a **_potential_** link between _P. gingivalis_, the bacteria associated with periodontal disease (commonly known as gum disease) and Alzheimer’s.

> Infectious agents have been found in the brain and postulated to be involved with AD, but **_robust evidence of causation has not been established_**.
