> The United States makes up 5% of the world’s population, but nearly [20%](https://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/wppl_12.pdf) of the world’s prison population. We have the [highest rate](http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison_population_rate?field_region_taxonomy_tid=All) of incarceration in the world, with over [2 million](https://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/wppl_12.pdf) people in prison and jail.

> Our system is the result of the dozens of choices we’ve made — choices that together stack the deck against the poor and the disadvantaged. Simply put, we have criminalized too many things. We send too many people to jail. We keep them there for too long. We do little to rehabilitate them. We spend [billions](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/money.html), propping up [an entire industry](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/capitalizing-on-mass-incarceration-u-s-growth-in-private-prisons/) that profits from mass incarceration. And we do all of this despite [little evidence](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/25/16340782/study-mass-incarceration) that our harshly punitive system makes our communities safer — and knowing that a majority of people currently in prison will eventually return to our communities and our neighborhoods.
